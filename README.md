# Surfs_up
## Written report for the statistical analysis

With this project we able to help our client W. Avy figure wether it is a great idea to open a Ice Cream and Surf shop. With that being said we have to determine the out comes based on the review of June and December. We also will have to look at the temperature for all the other months to see if the weather will be consistant through out the year. Our client, W. Avy, is planning on keeping the shop open year long. By doing this analysis will help her figure out if that will be possible.
